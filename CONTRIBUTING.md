# Contributions

In order to contribute use GitHub's Issues and Pull Requests systems.

+ > **Issues**: For tracking bugs, queries, error reports, etc. open an Issue. 

+ > **Pull Request**: To add improvements, bug fixes, code refactors, new dependencies, etc., open a PR

## Issues

1. Please use relevant issue titles, instead of "help me fix this", "what is wrong", etc.
   + > If it is a query, use a `[Question]` or `[Query]` before the issue title.
   + > If it is definitely a bug in the bot, mark it as `[Bug]`.
   + > If it is an error on your end or not sure, then simply state the title with no marking.

2. Before you open up a new issue, please refer to the [closed issues](https://github.com/Hyperclaw79/PokeBall-SelfBot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) first.

3. If your issue got closed but it hasn't been resolved, please reopen that issue instead of creating a new one.
   + > If it is a new type of error, then you can create a new issue.

4. Do not hesitate to mention the issue number of another issue (open/closed) if it is relevant to your own issue. Just make sure it is not a duplicate.
   + > For example, you tried out the steps in another issue but came up with a new error, mention that issue number in `#num` format.

5. Always try to fit it all your messages and content in a single comment. You can always edit a previous comment to add new info. Just add a `*Edit*` before it.

6. Feel free to comment on other's issues if you have any info pertaining to it.

## Pull request

1. Open a PR only if you are certain that it will have an advantage over the current code.

2. Use the following tags in the title to classify the PR:
   + > **Docs**: Improvements in the documentation of the repo/code.
   + > **Bug Fix**: For patches that fix the ongoing bugs.
   + > **Enhancement**: For code refactoring and improvements in the code.
   + > **New Feature**: For adding new features and functions.

3. Describe your PR accurately. Within the code, comment at the changes, explaining why it is an improvement.
   + > The body of the PR should summarize all the changes.

4. Make sure your fork is upto date with the master branch before adding your modifications to it.
   + > Google up how to keep forks in sync with the origin. *Spoiler* (You'll need to download Git Bash and make changes locally.)

5. PRs will be merged only after a thorough review by me. So stay patient till I check them out.
   + > I usually give PRs maximum priority unless there is a [Breaking Bug] or a [Major Update].

6. Make sure you test out your modifications locally and also make sure that they can be applied globally, not just limited to your local system.
